        <p>"I really love the sense of satisfaction that comes from seeing a fully-styled webpage that ultimately just comes from a set of instructions I've written to a computer.  It's a cool concept and I am always wondering how to go about being a better coder and designer.  I am new to programming, but it fits right in with my love of learning new languages.  Besides that, there's not much I love more than hanging out on the beach, meditating in the Sun and letting inspiration come to me."</p>
