            <h2><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Who We Are</h2>
            <p> We are a independent group sent out to solve a problem. Attendance and scheduling for fitness classes for both trainers and clients is always something that is difficult to log and keep updated on. Having to use multiable apps to keep up can be confusing.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> What We Do</h2>
            <p>Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing. While you could use several mobile apps to accomplish this, AnywhereFitness is the all-in-one solution to meet your “on-location” fitness class needs. AnywhereFitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held. Instructors can take attendance, request and process payments, create virtual “punch passes” for each type of class offered, alert clients of cancellations or location changes and so much more. Clients can easily find out information on classes - location, class size, start time and duration, as well as reschedule or cancel an upcoming appointment or reservation right from the mobile app.
